This guide explains how to configure and use the plugin using the new setup wizard.

= 1. Initial Configuration (Step 1) =

Before the plugin can work, you must connect it to your AgeWallet account. If you don't have an account yet, register one at https://app.agewallet.io/register — new accounts receive $5 of free verification credit.

1. Click AgeWallet in your WordPress admin menu to see the Welcome screen.
2. Click on Step 1: API Credentials.
3. In the "API Configuration" section, you will see a field labeled Redirect URI. Copy this URL.
4. Log in to your AgeWallet business account dashboard at https://app.agewallet.io.
5. Create a new application and paste the Redirect URI from the plugin settings into the corresponding field in your AgeWallet dashboard.
6. AgeWallet will provide you with a Client ID and a Client Secret.
7. Copy these keys and paste them into the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" fields in the plugin settings.
8. Click "Save Changes", then click "Next: Content Guarding".

= 2. Setting up Protection Rules (Step 2) =

You have several ways to protect content. You can mix and match these methods on the Step 2: Content Guarding page.

= A. Security Mode =

* Standard (Overlay): The page loads normally, but a CSS overlay covers the content. Verified users see the content revealed instantly. Best for SEO.
* High Security (Strict): The server sends a generic "Skeleton" page instead of your content. Secure content is fetched via an API call only after the user is verified. This prevents bypassing the gate by disabling JavaScript.
* WooCommerce pages (shop, products, product categories and tags, cart, checkout, account, and pages with WooCommerce product blocks or shortcodes) always use Standard mode, even when High Security is on, so shoppers' carts and WooCommerce messages work as normal.

= B. Global Scope =

* No automatic protection: Only protects content you specify manually (via Paths, Per-Post settings, or Shortcodes).
* Protect entire site, except homepage: Gates every page and post except your front page.
* Protect entire site, including homepage: Gates every single page on your site.

= C. Taxonomy Rules =

You can define rules based on Categories, Tags, or Custom Taxonomies (like WooCommerce Product Categories).
* Gate All Terms: Gates every post belonging to that taxonomy.
* Exclude All Terms: Ensures posts in that taxonomy are always public.
* Specific Rules: Search for specific terms (e.g., "Premium Content" category) to Gate or Exclude individually. Note: Exclusion rules take priority over Gating rules.

= D. Path-Based Rules =

* Paths to Protect: (Only active if "Protect only specific URL paths" is selected above). Enter comma-separated paths. Any URL containing these paths will be gated. Example: `/shop/, /videos/` will protect `example.com/shop/`, `example.com/shop/product-1/`, and `example.com/videos/my-video/`.
* Paths to Exclude: Enter paths that should always be public, even if 'Protect entire site' is on. Example: `/privacy-policy/, /terms/`.

= E. WooCommerce (visible when WooCommerce is active) =

The Content Guarding page shows a "WooCommerce" section below the Taxonomy Rules. The plugin also adds an "AgeWallet" tab to the Product Data metabox and a checkbox to the term-edit screens for Categories and Tags.

Checkout Gating chooses which products shoppers must verify their age to buy:

* Off: no purchase rule. Products can be bought without verifying; your page protection rules (scope, paths, taxonomies) still apply as normal.
* Force Always: shoppers must verify before they can buy any product, and every visit to the checkout page requires verification.
* Conditional on Cart: shoppers must verify before they can buy a product flagged as regulated. Useful for mixed-catalog stores where only some products require age gating.

For a product that needs verification, until the shopper verifies: its add-to-cart area (including any express payment buttons, such as PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay) is replaced by a "Verify my age" button that starts verification and brings them back to the product; WooCommerce refuses to add it to any cart, by any route; and checkout refuses any order containing it. After verifying, the product can be bought as normal. Product pages stay the same for every visitor, so page caching keeps working; clear your page cache once after updating the plugin.

Checkout Metadata Fields: pick which cart-context values get attached to each verification as metadata that round-trips through the OIDC flow back to your backend. Available fields: cart hash, cart total, currency code, WordPress user ID, billing country, number of line items. Defaults: cart hash, cart total, currency. Use the `agewallet_wc_checkout_metadata` filter (see Developer Hooks) for fully custom payloads.

Per-Product Regulated Status: open any product in WooCommerce > Products > Edit Product > AgeWallet tab.

* Not regulated (default): follows the product's categories and tags.
* Regulated: shoppers must verify their age before they can buy this product (Conditional on Cart).
* Override — explicitly not regulated: lets this product be bought without verifying even when one of its categories or tags is flagged regulated. Useful for an edge product inside an otherwise-regulated category.

Per-Category / Per-Tag Regulated Flag: on the term-edit screens (Products > Categories or Products > Tags), check "Regulated: shoppers must verify their age to buy (AgeWallet)". Products inherit the regulated flag from any of their categories or tags (unless overridden per-product). Clear your page cache after changing it.

Two per-product settings: the AgeWallet tab in Product data (Regulated status) controls buying; the Age Restriction box in the product's sidebar controls viewing the product's page (see section 5). Require in the sidebar gates the page but doesn't stop buying; only Regulated (or a regulated category or tag) does.

= 3. Customizing the Gate Appearance (Step 3) =

You can customize the age gate to match your brand on the Step 3: Gate Appearance page.

* Gate Logo: Upload or select a logo from your Media Library.
* Logo Width (px): Set a specific width for your logo, or leave at 0 for natural size.
* Gate Copy: Use the text editor to change the main message your users see.
* Hide Default Heading: Check this box to remove the "You Must Verify Your Age" title (e.g., if your custom copy already includes a title).
* Colours: Pick the overlay backdrop, card background and border, body and disclaimer text colours, and the Agree / Disagree button colours from the dedicated colour pickers.
* Card / button border radius: Set how rounded the card and buttons appear.
* For anything beyond these structured controls (custom fonts, site-wide rules, advanced selectors, hover variants not in the form), use **Appearance → Customize → Additional CSS**. AgeWallet applies that CSS to the gate on both Standard and Strict modes — see the CSS Customization Guide below for the available class names.

= 4. Strict Mode Analytics (Step 4) =

Note: These settings only apply if you are using High Security (Strict) Mode.

Because Strict Mode short-circuits the theme during verification, the analytics tags your theme normally renders do NOT fire on the "Verifying..." loading screen. Enter the IDs of the services you use and AgeWallet renders their official snippets directly. Leave any field blank to skip it.

* Google Analytics 4 — Measurement ID (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
* Google Tag Manager — Container ID (`GTM-XXXXXXX`)
* Facebook Pixel — numeric Pixel ID

For analytics providers we don't ship a field for (Plausible, Fathom, Microsoft Clarity, Hotjar, etc.), add them via the `agewallet_skeleton_head` / `agewallet_skeleton_footer` action hooks in a small mu-plugin or your theme's `functions.php` — see the Developer Hooks section.

= 5. Per-Post / Per-Page Control =

On the Edit Post, Edit Page or Edit Product screen, you will see an "Age Restriction" box in the sidebar. It controls who can view that page, and it overrides your other page protection rules.

* Require age verification: Check this to force the gate on this single page, even if your global setting is "No automatic protection."
* Exclude from age verification: Check this to make the page viewable by anyone, even if it's in a protected path (like `/shop/`) or a protected Category.
* If both are ticked, Exclude wins.

On a WooCommerce product, this box only controls viewing. Whether the product can be bought before verifying is set separately, in Product data → AgeWallet (see section E). The two work independently: with Exclude ticked and the product Regulated, anyone can view the product's page, but it can't be bought until the shopper verifies.

= 6. Shortcode Protection =

To protect just one part of a post (like a single video or paragraph), wrap it in the `[agewallet_protected]` shortcode.

`[agewallet_protected]`
This content, and only this content, will be hidden until the user verifies their age.
`[/agewallet_protected]`

Note: Shortcode protection only works in Standard Mode. In Strict Mode, the shortcode will NOT work.

= 7. Caching & Maintenance =

If you use High Security Mode, the plugin generates static HTML caches of your protected pages to ensure speed.

* Automatic Management: The cache is automatically cleared when you update posts, switch themes, create/edit menus, or modify taxonomy terms.
* Scheduled Cleanup: You can configure an automatic cache purge schedule (default: every 4 hours) in the "Cache Control" settings tab.
* Manual Purge: If you change settings and don't see them update immediately, click the "Purge Cache" button available in the sidebar of any AgeWallet settings page (or under Cache Control).
